# It is possible to place 8 queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
# Thus, it requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

# Given a placement of 8 queens on the chessboard, if there is a pair of queens that violates this rule,
# print YES, otherwise print NO. The input consists of eight coordinate pairs, one pair per line,

# UNDERSTAND:
# The goal is to check if 8 queens on a chessboard are placed such that no two queens threaten each other.
# This means no two queens can be on the same row, column, or diagonal.
# Input: Two lists x and y representing the positions of queens on an 8x8 chessboard.
# Output: Print "YES" if any two queens threaten each other, otherwise print "NO".

# MATCH:
# This problem matches the "conflict detection" category, where we check for specific constraints.
# Constraints:
# 1. No two queens share the same row: x-coordinates must be unique.
# 2. No two queens share the same column: y-coordinates must be unique.
# 3. No two queens share the same diagonal:
#    - Diagonal condition 1: x[i] - y[i] must be unique for all queens.
#    - Diagonal condition 2: x[i] + y[i] must be unique for all queens.

# Initialize the inputs
# x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6]  # Row positions of the queens
# y = [5, 3, 1, 7, 2, 5, 6, 4]  # Column positions of the queens

# PLAN:
# 1. Use two lists x and y to store the positions of queens.
# 2. Iterate through the input to populate these lists.
# 3. Check if all constraints are satisfied:
#    - Rows (x), columns (y), and diagonals are unique.
# 4. Return "YES" if any constraint is violated, otherwise return "NO".
