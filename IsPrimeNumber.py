# Given a integer x, return a list of each prime number between 1 and n.
# A prime number is a number that is only divisible by itself and 1.
# (Example: 6 is not a prime number because 6 / 2 == 3. Meanwhile, 3 is a prime number because it's only divisible by itself and 1).
#
# Some code has been done for you: the function you'll actually be writing is the prime number number checker:
# Given an integer n, return True or False on whether it's a prime number or not.
# You don't have to worry about the list code if you're not familiar with lists yet.
# Note: 1 is not a prime number.
