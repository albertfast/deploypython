#I chose to write a Python program that prints the message "Consistency is key to becoming proficient in Python."
#I opened IDLE and typed the following code:

#print("Consistency is key to becoming proficient in Python.")

# Taking user's name and age as input
#name = input("Please enter your name: ")
#age = input("Please enter your age: ")

# Dynamically creating and printing the message
#print(f"Hello {name}! I heard you are {age} years old, welcome to Python programming!")

#The program was saved with the name myfirstprog
#I reviewed the program and ensured that it was free of errors. Everything worked perfectly, and the file was saved as myfirstprog.py in the correct location.
#In addition I tried Taking user input and printing.

#print some regular values and calculated values 
years = 5
D = 10
print("In", years, "years, $")
print(D, "deposited per month will grow to $")
print(years+D)

# code block to read a whole number from the keyboard
print("What is your age? ", end = "")
age = int(input()) # store as a whole number

# code block to read a floating point number from the keyboard
print("What is your grade point average? ", end = "")
gpa = float(input()) # store as a floating point number

# code block to read text from the keyboard
print("What is your name? ", end = "")
name = input() # store as text (Python's default)

# code block to read a single character from the keyboard
print("Are you feeling happy today? [Y/N]: ", end = "")
feelingHappy = input()[0] # store as a single character
